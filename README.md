# Sinking Ships!

## Welcome to the fleet!

Sinking ships is a command-line Python3 game of strategy (and more than a bit of luck).

Based primarily on the classic pen-and-paper game Battleships, Sinking Ships takes further inspiration from the eponymous 'Sinking Ships' mini-game in the 2002 video game Legend of Zelda - Wind Waker, where the player must locate and eliminate enemy squid before they have the chance to wreack havoc. The setting of the minigame combined with the mechanism of battleships is what constitutes Sinking Ships - a casual game with a humerous edge for anyone to while away a few minutes on.
